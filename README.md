## ✨ Why Smart Recipe Generator?

That’s the goal of **Smart Recipe Generator** — a modern full-stack web app that blends simplicity with intelligence.

Instead of being another static recipe site, this project is built to **adapt to the user**, providing:  
- 🧑‍🍳 A seamless way to **create & share your own recipes**  
- 💾 A personal **saves collection** to bookmark your favorites  
- 🎯 Smart **filters & search** to actually find what you need  
- 📱 A design that looks equally stunning on mobile and desktop
